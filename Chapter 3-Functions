Functions
=========
A function is like a mini-program within a program. Type this program into the file editor and save it as helloFunc.py:

➊ def hello():
➋     print('Howdy!')
       print('Howdy!!!')
       print('Hello there.')
➌ hello()
   hello()
   hello()

The first line is a def statement ➊, which defines a function named hello(). The code in the block that follows the def 
statement ➋ is the body of the function. This code is executed when the function is called, not when the function is first 
defined.The hello() lines after the function ➌ are function calls. In code, a function call is just the function’s name 
followed by parentheses, possibly with some number of arguments in between the parentheses. When you run this program, the 
output looks like this:

Howdy!
Howdy!!!
Hello there.
Howdy!
Howdy!!!
Hello there.
Howdy!
Howdy!!!
Hello there.
