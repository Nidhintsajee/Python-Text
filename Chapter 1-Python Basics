Entering Expressions into the Interactive Shell
-----------------------------------------------
 On Ubuntu, open a new Terminal window and enter idle3. A window with the >>> prompt should appear; thatâ€™s the interactive 
 shell. Enter 2 + 2 at the prompt to have Python do some simple math. The IDLE window should now show some text like this:

Python 3.3.2 (v3.3.2:d047928ae3f6, May 16 2013, 00:06:53) [MSC v.1600 64 bit
(AMD64)] on win32
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>>
There are plenty of other operators you can use in Python expressions, too. For example, lists all the math operators in 
Python. Math Operators from Highest to Lowest Precedence
Operator    Operation         Example   Evaluates to...
**          Exponent          2 ** 3    8
%           Modulus/
            remainder         22 % 8    6
//          Integer division/
            floored quotient  22 // 8   2
/           Division          22 / 8    2.75
*           Multiplication    3 * 5     15
-           Subtraction       5 - 2     3
